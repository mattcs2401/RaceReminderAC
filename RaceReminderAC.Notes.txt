Issues:
-------
(1) Multiple swipe to deletes.
    Quickly swiping to delete multiple entries causes display issue when SnackBar based UNDO
    function is enabled.

    Note: If wait till after SnackBar, then all OK.
          Likely a timing issue as deletes are done on a background thread.

(2) If have say two records:
    - Swipe delete the 2nd record, and
    - before the SnackBar disappears, edit the 1st record and update, then
    - 2nd record re-appears.

    Note: If don't update, just press back, then all OK.
          Likely a timing issue as edits are done on a background thread (similar point 1 above).

(3) Lifecycle issue with refresh slider:
    - If enabled, and navigate from preferences back to activity, then
    - activity sent to background (not in view), then
    - when activity in view again, the preference shows as disabled.

------
TO DO:
------
 --> Consider using the Anko library
     https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/wiki

 -->  XX minutes after race time, record auto removes from view ?
      - what if race is late starting ?

 --> Update/Refresh UI accordingly, at preference controlled interval.
     - in progress.
