Issues:
-------
(1) Multiple swipe to deletes.
    Quickly swiping to delete multiple entries causes display issue.

    Note: If wait till after SnackBar, then all OK.
          Likely a timing issue as deletes are done on a background thread.

(2) If have say two records:
    - swipe delete the 2nd record, and
    - before the SnackBar disappears, edit the 1st record and update, then
    - 2nd record re-appears.

    Note: If don't update, just press back, than all OK.
