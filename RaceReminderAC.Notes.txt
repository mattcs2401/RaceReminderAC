Issues:
-------
>> Multiple swipe to deletes:
   Quickly swiping to delete multiple entries causes display issue when SnackBar based UNDO
   function is enabled.

   Note: If wait till after SnackBar, then all OK.
         Likely a timing issue as deletes are done on a background thread.

>> If have say two records:
   - Swipe delete the 2nd record, and
   - before the SnackBar disappears, edit the 1st record and update, then
   - 2nd record re-appears.

   Note: If don't update, just press back, then all OK.
         Likely a timing issue as edits are done on a background thread (similar point 1 above).

------
TO DO:
------
-> If race time is in the past:
   -> Don't send reminder notifications.
   -> Don't refresh the race (UI colour).

-> Consider a network connection for:
   "https://tatts.com/pagedata/racing" and associated pages, e.g.;
    - https://tatts.com/pagedata/racing/YYYY/M(M)/D(D)/NR1.xml

    Android training: https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html

-> 1) Preference controls use of the network connection (WiFi or Mobile data (or both ?)).
   2) If preference enabled:
      2.1) When a new Race is entered, use Volley to get the xml data from tatts.com
           -> use today's date, meeting code and race number.
      2.2) When Volley returns, use a background worker to parse the xml.

      What do we do with the parsed xml ?
      - have in memory pojos, or write to database table/s ?
      - what information are we really interested in ?

-> Make the number picker values bigger.
   - Add/Edit screen design ?

-> Consider using the Anko library
   https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/wiki

->  XX minutes after race time, record auto removes from view ?
    - Preferences controlled ?
    - What if the race is late starting ?
    - What about a screen that shows those removed ?
