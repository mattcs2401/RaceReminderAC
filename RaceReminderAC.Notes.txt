** Project notes/comments/etc in no particular order. **

-------
Issues:
-------
>> When Home screen comes to the foreground (from the background):
   Refresh/update the UI time related information.

>> Lifecycle issue with refresh slider:
   - If enabled, and navigate from preferences back to activity, then
   - activity sent to background (not in view), then
   - when activity in view again, the preference shows as disabled.

>> Multiple swipe to deletes:
   Quickly swiping to delete multiple entries causes display issue when SnackBar based UNDO
   function is enabled.

   Note: If wait till after SnackBar, then all OK.
         Likely a timing issue as deletes are done on a background thread.

>> If have say two records:
   - Swipe delete the 2nd record, and
   - before the SnackBar disappears, edit the 1st record and update, then
   - 2nd record re-appears.

   Note: If don't update, just press back, then all OK.
         Likely a timing issue as edits are done on a background thread (similar point 1 above).

------
TO DO:
------
-> Make the number picker values bigger.

-> Consider using the Anko library
   https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/wiki

->  XX minutes after race time, record auto removes from view ?
    - what if race is late starting ?

-> Update/Refresh UI accordingly, at preference controlled interval.
   - in progress.
