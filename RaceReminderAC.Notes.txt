Issues:
-------
>> Multiple swipe to deletes:
   Quickly swiping to delete multiple entries causes display issue when SnackBar based UNDO
   function is enabled.

   Note: If wait till after SnackBar, then all OK.
         Likely a timing issue as deletes are done on a background thread.

>> If have say two records:
   - Swipe delete the 2nd record, and
   - before the SnackBar disappears, edit the 1st record and update, then
   - 2nd record re-appears.

   Note: If don't update, just press back, then all OK.
         Likely a timing issue as edits are done on a background thread (similar point 1 above).

TO DO:
------
-> Expandable recyclerview:
   Example - https://thoughtbot.com/blog/introducing-expandablerecyclerview
   For horse, jockey trainer names.
   -> Will need to upgrade the Race entity (done).
   -> Will need to upgrade the Edit functionality (TBA).

-> Make the number picker values bigger.
   - Addd/Edit screen design ?

-> Consider using the Anko library
   https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/wiki

->  XX minutes after race time, record auto removes from view ?
    - Prferences controlled ?
    - What if the race is late starting ?
    - What about a screen that shows those removed ?
